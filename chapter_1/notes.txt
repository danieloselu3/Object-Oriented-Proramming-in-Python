CHAPTER 1 : Object Oriented Design

In this chapter will learn:
    1.What Object-Oriented means.
    2.The difference btw Object-Oriented Design and Object-oriented programming.
    3.The basic principles of Object-oriented design.
    4.Basic Unified Modeling Language(UML) and when it isn't evil.

Object Oriented Analysis(OOA)
Is the process of looking at a task, system or problem that has to be turned into a program and identifying the objects and interaction between these objects.
The analysis stage is all about what needs to be done.
In this stage, we would turn the task "I need a website" into a set of requirement, such as;
    Visitors in the website need to be able to:
    --> review(action) our history(Object)
    --> apply(action) for jobs(Object)
    --> browse(action), compare(action), and order(action) our products(Object)

Object Oriented design(OOD)
Is the process of converting such requirements into an implementation specification.
The designer must name the objects, define their behaviors, and formally specify what objects can activate specific behaviors on other objects.
In this stage we would have turned the requirements into a set of classes and interfaces that could be implemented in any OOP language.

Object Oriented Programming(OOP)
Is the process of converting this perfectly defined defined design into a working program that does exactly what it was intended to do.
